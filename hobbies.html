    <h1><strong>Akshansh's Hobbies:-</strong></h1>
    <p>I have a lot of hobbies. There are so many things that I love to do. However, more often that not, I get so between
    studies and my social life that I cannot make time for my hobbies. I have been trying to be more organized these days
    and make some extra time for my hobbies. Okay, I think I have rambled enough now it is time for me to list out my favourite
    hobbies.
    </p>
    <ol type="i">
      <li><strong>Dancing:</strong> I am the kind of person that if I hear any good song playing, or if I see another person energetically dancing to some
        groovy music I will inadvertantly join them. I have not been able to devote any time to dancing ever since I have grown up. It's difficult for me to
        manage time for my studies as it is, however I will still try to make more time for it.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Singing:</strong>I love to sing. I have always been fond of listening to music and singing, of course. My favourite music artists are Taylor
      Swift, Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber. My favourite songs are Young in Love by Ingrid Michaelson and Remember by Seinabo Sey.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Binge Watching:</strong>I am so very fond of watching movies and web series. I have watched plethora of shows. My favourite shows are
       Stranger Things, The Office and 13 Reasons Why. And my favourite movies are The Shawshank Redemption, the Harry Potter Series and La La Land.
